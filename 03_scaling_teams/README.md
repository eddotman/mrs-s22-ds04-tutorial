# How do you scale ML systems and teams, beyond what's in this tutorial?

This is a **big** question, far beyond the scope of this tutorial. What you'll find below is a short list of some key concepts, alongside examples of open source tooling that may help you along the way. :) 

**Please note**: Many of these tooling categories are somewhat overlapping! 

1. Compute pipelines and managing workloads: [Dagster](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster), [Ray](https://www.ray.io/)
1. Managing ML experiments and keeping them reproducible: [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/)
1. Exposing ML models to the web: [Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
1. Versioning your data and code: [DVC](https://dvc.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/)
1. Quickly sharing code and visualizations: [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
1. Controlling dependencies and libraries: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
